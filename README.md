# C-Library-for-IOT-Converter-MODBUS-RTU-to-CAN

This library represents C library for IOT  converters - Modbus to CAN and vice-versa. Here there are two devices in which one is working on MODBUS protocol and taking data from Modbus Energy Meter. The configuration parameters are set up through PC using any Modbus Master Software. Once the data is taken, it is transferred over CAN and received it on Arduino IDE over the receiver end. Similarly, the data from CAN is transferred from the Arduino IDE, which is received on the PC over Modbus conversion.
